### What is Web Application?
A web application is software that runs on a web browser, enabling users to perform specific tasks. It consists of a front end (client-side) and a back end (server-side), developed using languages like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python.

### What is Web Hacking?
Web hacking refers to exploiting web applications through HTTP, manipulating their graphical interfaces to gain unauthorized access or perform malicious actions. It is a significant aspect of cybersecurity.

### URL and URI
A URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) identifies a resource, while a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) specifies the web address of a resource. A URI can contain components like scheme, authority, path, and query, while a URL includes a domain name and port.

### How does the Web Work?
Websites operate by sending HTTP requests from browsers to servers, which respond with web files. Understanding this interaction is essential for web hacking.

### Web Information Gathering
This process involves collecting information about a web application to identify potential vulnerabilities. It includes reconnaissance techniques like scanning and enumeration.

### Burp Suite
Burp Suite is a comprehensive tool for penetration testing of web applications. It allows security testers to intercept requests, analyze responses, and identify vulnerabilities.

### OWASP Top 10
The OWASP Top 10 is a list of the most critical security risks for web applications. It serves as a guideline for developers to ensure secure coding practices.

### Web Vulnerabilities
Common web vulnerabilities include SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and broken authentication. These weaknesses can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access or manipulate data.
